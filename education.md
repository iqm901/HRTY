## Module 1: Taking Control of Heart Failure

*[Source: HFSA Module 1]*

### What is Heart Failure?
- Heart failure means the heart is not pumping blood through the body as well as it should *[HFSA]*
- It is NOT cardiac arrest, but rather weakened pumping action causing blood backup and fluid congestion *[HFSA]*
- Fluid accumulation in lungs causes breathing difficulty *[HFSA]*
- Often accompanied by swollen legs and feet *[HFSA]*
- Also called congestive heart failure *[HFSA]*
- Is serious but manageable with proper care *[HFSA]*

### Common Causes
- Heart attacks (ischemic cardiomyopathy) *[HFSA]*
- High blood pressure *[HFSA]*
- Heart muscle infection/inflammation *[HFSA]*
- Valve problems *[HFSA]*
- Lung disease and diabetes *[HFSA]*
- Excessive long-term alcohol use *[HFSA]*
- Sometimes cause unknown (idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy) *[HFSA]*

### Essential Self-Management Actions
- Take all prescribed medications at correct doses *[HFSA]*
- Follow low-sodium diet *[HFSA]*
- Stop smoking *[HFSA]*
- Stay physically active *[HFSA]*
- Achieve healthy weight *[HFSA]*
- Limit alcohol *[HFSA]*
- Daily self-monitoring (weigh yourself, check for swelling) *[HFSA]*

### Understanding Ejection Fraction
- Measures percentage of blood pumped out each time heart beats *[HFSA]*
- Normal: 50-65% *[HFSA]*
- Damaged heart: below 40% (systolic heart failure) *[HFSA]*
- Normal ejection fraction doesn't rule out heart failure (diastolic type) *[HFSA]*

### Key Questions for Your Doctor
1. Are my coronary arteries blocked? *[HFSA]*
2. Is my blood pressure controlled? *[HFSA]*
3. Are my heart valves damaged? *[HFSA]*
4. What is my ejection fraction? *[HFSA]*

## Module 2: How to Follow a Low-Sodium Diet

*[Source: HFSA Module 2]*

### Goals
- Limit intake to 2,000-3,000 mg daily *[HFSA]*
- One teaspoon of salt = approximately 2,300 mg sodium *[HFSA]*
- Mild heart failure: typically 3,000 mg limit *[HFSA]*
- Moderate-to-severe: typically 2,000 mg limit *[HFSA]*
- AHA recommends less than 1,500 mg of sodium per day *[AHA]*
- A "low sodium" food label means 140 mg or less per serving *[AHA]*

### Four Steps to Reduce Sodium

**Step 1: Stop Adding Salt**
- Remove saltshakers from tables *[HFSA]*
- Stop adding salt during cooking *[HFSA]*
- This alone reduces sodium by approximately 30% *[HFSA]*
- Taste buds adapt over weeks *[HFSA]*

**Step 2: Adapt Favorite Foods**
- Create homemade low-sodium versions of preferred dishes *[HFSA]*
- Select foods labeled "sodium-free," "no-salt," "reduced-sodium," or "unsalted" *[HFSA]*
- Rinse canned foods to remove some sodium *[HFSA]*

**Step 3: Choose Naturally Low-Sodium Foods**
- Fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats *[HFSA]*
- Plain frozen vegetables and canned fruits *[HFSA]*
- Dried beans, peas, rice, and lentils without added salt *[HFSA]*

**Step 4: Read Food Labels**
- Most processed foods contain excessive sodium *[HFSA]*
- Compare serving sizes to actual portions consumed *[HFSA]*
- Track sodium accumulation across all meals *[HFSA]*
- Some medicines are also high in sodium—always read warnings before taking OTC medications *[AHA]*

### Good Seasoning Alternatives
Allspice, basil, bay leaves, black pepper, cayenne, chili powder, cinnamon, cloves, cumin, dill, garlic powder, ginger, lemon juice, dry mustard, nutmeg, onion powder, oregano, paprika, parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, vinegar *[HFSA]*

### High-Sodium Seasonings to Avoid
- Garlic salt or celery salt (about 1,500 mg per teaspoon) *[HFSA]*
- Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce *[HFSA]*
- Most ketchups, taco seasonings, bouillon *[HFSA]*

### Restaurant Dining Tips
- Choose restaurants offering fresh food options *[HFSA]*
- Check sodium content online before arriving *[HFSA]*
- Request preparation without added salt, MSG, or soy sauce *[HFSA]*
- Request sauces and dressings on the side *[HFSA]*
- Avoid dishes named "au gratin," "Parmesan," "casserole," or "Newberg" *[HFSA]*

### Why Sodium Matters
- Excessive sodium intake may trigger weight gain, shortness of breath, and leg/ankle/feet swelling *[HFSA]*
- Adequate sodium restriction enhances diuretic medication effectiveness *[HFSA]*
- Keep salt intake below 5g daily through food preparation modifications *[ESC]*

## Module 10: Heart Rhythm Problems

*[Source: HFSA Module 10]*

### Normal Heart Function
- The heart has an electrical system that causes it to beat and pump blood *[HFSA]*
- Signal originates in the sinus node, travels through atria to the AV node, then to ventricles *[HFSA]*
- Normally, the heart beats in a regular and coordinated way *[HFSA]*

### Types of Arrhythmias

**Fast/Irregular Rhythms:**
- **Atrial fibrillation:** Most common; rapid, irregular upper chamber beats; increases stroke risk *[HFSA]*
- **Atrial flutter:** Similar to fibrillation but less irregular *[HFSA]*
- **Supraventricular tachycardia:** Fast rhythm from upper chambers *[HFSA]*
- **Ventricular tachycardia:** Rapid lower chamber rhythm; potentially life-threatening *[HFSA]*
- **Ventricular fibrillation:** Most serious; causes unconsciousness and sudden death without immediate treatment *[HFSA]*

**Slow Rhythms:**
- **Heart block:** AV node damage impairs signal transmission *[HFSA]*

**Other Issues:**
- **PACs/PVCs:** Extra heartbeats occurring prematurely *[HFSA]*
- **Sick sinus syndrome:** Sinus node fails to initiate regular beats *[HFSA]*

### Warning Symptoms
- Skipped beats, fluttering or pounding sensations *[HFSA]*
- Dizziness or light-headedness *[HFSA]*
- Sudden shortness of breath *[HFSA]*
- Weakness or fainting episodes *[HFSA]*

### Diagnostic Tests
- **ECG:** Records electrical activity *[HFSA]*
- **Holter Monitor:** Worn 24-48 hours to capture rhythm during daily activities *[HFSA]*
- **Tilt Table Test:** Evaluates heart rhythm response to position changes *[HFSA]*
- **EP Study:** Catheter-based assessment identifying rhythm origin *[HFSA]*

### Treatment Options

**Procedures:**
- **Cardioversion:** Electrical shock to restore normal rhythm *[HFSA]*
- **Catheter ablation:** Destroys tissue causing abnormal rhythm *[HFSA]*

**Devices:**
- **Pacemakers:** Address slow heart rates *[HFSA]*
- **ICDs:** Deliver shocks for dangerous rhythms *[HFSA]*
- **CRT devices:** Coordinate pumping action in both ventricles *[HFSA]*

**Medications:**
- Antiarrhythmics: Control rhythm abnormalities *[HFSA]*
- Anticoagulants (blood thinners): Essential for atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke *[HFSA]*

### Blood Thinner Safety
- Take exactly as prescribed *[HFSA]*
- Maintain consistent dietary vitamin K intake if on warfarin *[HFSA]*
- Keep all monitoring appointments *[HFSA]*
- Report any bruising or bleeding immediately *[HFSA]*
- Inform all healthcare providers of blood thinner use *[HFSA]*

### Rhythm Problem Triggers to Avoid
- Over-the-counter medications (cough, cold remedies) *[HFSA]*
- Abnormal electrolyte levels, particularly potassium *[HFSA]*
- Excessive exercise *[HFSA]*
- Alcohol consumption *[HFSA]*
- Smoking *[HFSA]*

## Daily Weight Monitoring

*[Source: AHA Discharge Packet 2022]*

### The Critical Rule
- **Call your provider if you gain more than 2 pounds (1 kg) in a day, or 5 pounds (2 kg) in a week** *[AHA]*
- Research shows patients educated on daily weighing are more likely to follow sodium restrictions and not smoke *[AHA]*

### Sodium Guidelines
- Take in less than 1,500 mg of sodium per day *[AHA]*
- "Low sodium" on food labels means 140 mg or less per serving *[AHA]*
- Some medicines are also high in sodium—always read sodium content and warnings before taking OTC medications *[AHA]*

### Evidence for Patient Education
- A 1-hour, one-on-one teaching session with a nurse educator improves outcomes compared to standard discharge *[AHA]*
- Patients receiving enhanced education are more likely to weigh themselves daily and follow sodium restrictions *[AHA]*
- Early follow-up after discharge significantly reduces readmission rates *[AHA]*

### Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (2022 Update)
- GDMT for HFrEF now includes 4 medication classes *[AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022]*
- SGLT2 inhibitors (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) are now part of standard therapy *[AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022]*

## The Weight Monitoring Rule

*[Source: AAHFN]*

### When to Call Your Healthcare Team
- **If your weight goes up 2 pounds in one day OR 5 pounds in one week, call to speak to the nurse or heart failure team** *[AAHFN]*
- Changes in weight may be a sign of fluid retention *[AAHFN]*

### Proper Weighing Technique
1. **Scale Placement:** Place your scale in a handy location on a flat surface without carpet. If you have carpet, place a thin board under your scale *[AAHFN]*
2. **Calibration Check:** Step on and off the scale three times. The scale should read your weight within one pound each time *[AAHFN]*
3. **Timing:** Each morning, step on the scale after you empty your bladder. Weigh before eating or drinking *[AAHFN]*
4. **Consistency:** Always weigh in the same clothing or no clothing *[AAHFN]*
5. **Recording:** Record your weight every day. Weighing twice a day is not necessary *[AAHFN]*

### Research Evidence
- Patients experience gradual weight gain beginning approximately 30 days before hospitalization *[Circulation Research]*
- Within the week before hospitalization, weight gains are associated with significantly higher odds of heart failure hospitalization *[Circulation Research]*:
  - >2 to 5 lbs: 2.77x higher odds
  - >5 to 10 lbs: 4.46x higher odds
  - >10 lbs: 7.65x higher odds

## Self-Care Maintenance

*[Source: ESC 2021]*

### Nutrition & Weight Management
- BMI >35 kg/m²: Consider weight reduction since this might improve functional capacity *[ESC]*
- Unintentional weight loss signals potential cachexia requiring immediate healthcare provider attention *[ESC]*
- Salt intake: Keep below 5g daily through food preparation modifications *[ESC]*
- Fluid intake: Limit to 1.5-2L in severe cases; adjust during heat/humidity *[ESC]*
- Alcohol: Maximum 2 units/day (men) or 1 unit/day (women); complete abstinence if alcohol-related HF *[ESC]*
- Supplements: Obtain micronutrients from varied diet; consult team before herbal/supplement use *[ESC]*
- High potassium levels: Restrict potassium-containing foods and supplements *[ESC]*

### Physical Activity
- Undertake daily and regular exercise: walking, cycling, swimming *[ESC]*
- Adapt intensity to symptoms and personal preferences *[ESC]*
- Exercise at levels producing mild-to-moderate breathlessness when possible *[ESC]*
- Avoid extreme athleticism *[ESC]*
- Seek team guidance on safe exercise types *[ESC]*

### Medication Adherence
- Understand medication rationale, benefits, and potential side effects *[ESC]*
- Involve family members in medication discussions if preferred *[ESC]*
- Use reminder tools: dosette boxes, electronic alerts, phone reminders *[ESC]*
- When starting heart failure medication, temporary fatigue or tiredness is common *[ESC]*
- Report all perceived side effects *[ESC]*
- Space doses throughout day if dizziness occurs *[ESC]*
- Take diuretics morning/lunchtime to minimize daily disruption *[ESC]*

### Psychological Health
- Try to recognize concerns and worries and ask for help *[ESC]*
- Attend support groups for peer exchange *[ESC]*
- Discuss concerns with family, friends, or healthcare providers *[ESC]*
- Maintain physical activity despite low mood *[ESC]*

### Sleep
- Recognize good sleep promotes health *[ESC]*
- Avoid caffeine late in day *[ESC]*
- Evening relaxation: yoga, mindfulness, short walks *[ESC]*
- Avoid screens one hour before bed *[ESC]*
- Report orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or sleep apnea to providers *[ESC]*

### Immunization
- Annual influenza vaccination *[ESC]*
- One-time pneumococcal vaccination *[ESC]*

### Smoking & Substance Use

## Self-Care Monitoring

*[Source: ESC 2021]*

### Symptom Tracking Parameters
Monitor frequency, intensity, duration, pattern, and specificity of:

**Respiratory/Fluid Signs:**
- Dyspnea during activity and at rest *[ESC]*
- Orthopnea and nocturnal dyspnea *[ESC]*
- Edema (legs, ankles, abdomen, waist) *[ESC]*
- Cough or wheezing *[ESC]*

**Cardiac/Systemic:**
- Chest pain *[ESC]*
- Palpitations *[ESC]*
- Dizziness *[ESC]*
- Fatigue/tiredness *[ESC]*
- Decreased activity tolerance *[ESC]*

**Gastrointestinal:**
- Appetite loss/nausea *[ESC]*
- Thirst *[ESC]*

### Weight Monitoring Protocol
- Monitor weight regularly/daily in same conditions (e.g., after morning toilet, in light clothes), using same weighing scale *[ESC]*
- Sudden gain indicates fluid overload *[ESC]*
- Sudden loss indicates malnutrition or dehydration *[ESC]*
- **Rule: Sudden weight gain >2kg (4.4 lbs) in 3 days warrants review** *[ESC]*

### Additional Monitoring
- Pulse (for arrhythmia, fluid status) *[ESC]*
- Blood pressure *[ESC]*
- Fever, diarrhea, vomiting *[ESC]*
- Mood changes, depressive feelings, anxiety *[ESC]*
- Response to self-care interventions *[ESC]*

### Telemonitoring Options
- Non-invasive: Weight, pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, activity level, lung impedance *[ESC]*
- Invasive: Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring *[ESC]*
- Digital health applications may be used to track symptoms and share data with health care professionals *[ESC]*

## Self-Care Management: Responding to Symptoms

*[Source: ESC 2021]*

### Diuretic Adjustment
- Adjust doses per healthcare team guidance based on symptoms and weight changes *[ESC]*
- Adjust diuretic dose according to advice received, mainly relative to symptoms and weight variation *[ESC]*
- Use lowest dose maintaining euvolemia *[ESC]*
- May discontinue in euvolaemic/hypovolaemic patients per physician guidance *[ESC]*

### Medication Management During Illness
- ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics continued during acute hypovolaemic illness significantly increase the risk of acute kidney injury *[ESC]*
- Temporarily reduce or stop certain agents during acute gastroenteritis *[ESC]*
- Resume when condition stabilizes *[ESC]*

### Blood Pressure Considerations
- Low blood pressure readings without symptoms are no reason for concern *[ESC]*
- Asymptomatic hypotension doesn't require dose reduction *[ESC]*
- Elevate legs or stand slowly for dizziness management *[ESC]*

### Healthcare Provider Contact Triggers
- Do not hesitate to contact a health care professional if in need of support and advice *[ESC]*
- Acute illness with diarrhea/vomiting >24 hours *[ESC]*
- When uncertain about symptom responses *[ESC]*
- Experiencing new or worsening symptoms *[ESC]*
